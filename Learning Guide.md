# Numerical-Methods
Hello, welcome to my open source introduction to numerical methods in python. Each branch will cover a different topic and eventually, I will have video tutorials uploaded that go along with each notebook.

All of the pdfs will contain a quick summary about the topics that I will go into. Then, there are jupiter notebooks which are the files accompanied by videos.

Though it is helpful to know some calculus and basic python before getting this series, it is possible to start with this course and cover the prerequisite knowledge as you go.
