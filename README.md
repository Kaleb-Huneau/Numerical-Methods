# Numerical-Methods
Hello, welcome to my open source introduction to numerical methods in python. Each branch will cover a different topic and eventually, I will have video tutorials uploaded that go along with each notebook.

All of the pdfs will contain a quick summary about the topics that I will go into. Then, there are jupiter notebooks which are the files accompanied by videos.
